# No getter!

With the help of JavaParser implement a program that obtains the private fields of public classes that have no public getter in a Java project. 

A field has a public getter if, in the same class, there is a public method that simply returns the value of the field and whose name is `get<name-of-the-field>`.

For example, in the following class:

```Java

class Person {
    private int age;
    private String name;
    
    public String getName() { return name; }

    public boolean isAdult() {
        return age > 17;
    }
}
```

`name` has a public getter, while `age` doesn't.

The program should take as input the path to the source code of the project. It should produce a report in the format of your choice (TXT, CSV, Markdown, HTML, etc.) that lists for each detected field: its name, the name of the declaring class and the package of the declaring class.

Include in this repository the code of your application. Remove all unnecessary files like compiled binaries. See the [instructions](../sujet.md) for suggestions on the projects to use.

*Disclaimer* In a real project not all fields need to be accessed with a public getter.

### Answer of exercice 4
For this exercice, we have modified the class **PublicElementsPrinter** and more precisely, we had adapt the visitor patern. We also modified the class **Main** to create file and write the output in this file (the name of this file is _output.txt_). Finally we created a class name **App**. In this class, we made all modification and comparaison to prepare the output. You will find the project in the folder **Tp2**
